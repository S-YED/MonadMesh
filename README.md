# MonadMesh
MonadMesh is a decentralized serverless compute network that runs pure functions (WASM/Python) across a peer-to-peer node mesh, using Monadâ€™s parallel blockchain for execution tracking. It features live dashboards, ZK-proof toggles, and a visual P2P map, think Cloudflare meets IPFS with on-chain speed.
