# ⚡ MonadMesh – Decentralized Serverless Functions with Peer-to-Peer Parallel Execution

**MonadMesh** is a decentralized compute network that enables developers to submit pure functions (in WASM or Python), which are then executed across a peer-to-peer (P2P) network of nodes—powered by [Monad](https://monad.xyz)'s blazing-fast parallel blockchain.

> 💡 Think Cloudflare Workers meets IPFS meets Monad’s superpowers.

## 🧪 How It Works

### 🔁 Workflow

1. 📝 **Submit Function**:  
   User writes a pure function in Python/WASM via the frontend.

2. 🧠 **Task Orchestration**:  
   A Python orchestrator distributes the task to participating P2P nodes.

3. 🔗 **On-Chain Tracking**:  
   Monad smart contracts handle task hash, node states, and result commits.

4. ⚙️ **Parallel Execution**:  
   Nodes compute the task in parallel and submit the results on-chain.

5. 📊 **Frontend Display**:  
   Results are visualized on the dashboard with live WebSocket updates.
